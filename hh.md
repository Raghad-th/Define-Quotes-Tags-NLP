The main focus of this project is predict a tags topic modeling to predict the correct tag of quote can correctly classify the topic.
Design:
Using supervised and semi-supervised learning with Natural Learning Processing (NLP), throughout the project we will categorize the tag category based on the quote.So that when someone writes this quote it will give a quote similar to the quote's category.
Data:
We have 2 dataset  the first one from Kaggel consist of 499,709 with 3 features and the second one web scraping from goodreads contain 83,618 with 3 features.
After pre-processing we decide to used data from kaggel because it is more useful, specifically the length of the quotes and topic modelling. The features consist of quotes, authers and category
